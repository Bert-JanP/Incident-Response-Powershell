# Remediation

To run the Remediation scripts you first need to install the Graph PowerShell module. 
You can install it by running the PowerShell command below. If you do not want to install all PowerShell Graph modules you can change the installation to only install the needed modules.

```PowerShell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
```
